	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.

	<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Space complexity</span> is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.</p>
